My Github account will be used for this CTI class and any future projects in coding. 
The repository I created will be used to host code and manage updates/additions in an organized manner.
To clone the repository I first created the main repository on the Github website and then through the desktop app made a clone repostiory that is located on the harddrive of my computer.
